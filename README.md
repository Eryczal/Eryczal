# Hi, I'm Eryk! 👋


## 🚀 About Me
As a self-taught programmer, I embarked on my coding journey at a young age. My passion lies in JavaScript, which I utilize to craft interactive web applications and games. I have developed numerous Single Page Applications (SPAs) using Vanilla JS, React, and a JavaScript library of my own creation.
